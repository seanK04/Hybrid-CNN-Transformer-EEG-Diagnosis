In this repository, we present a novel approach for diagnosing harmful brain activity using a hybrid CNN-Transformer model applied to electroencephalogram (EEG) data. The model's architecture leverages both locally and globally learned features from spectrograms generated using wavelet-transformed EEG waveforms. Our methodology begins with preprocessing raw EEG data from the Harvard Medical School dataset, employing Fast Fourier Transform and wavelet transformation via the librosa library to create comprehensive spectrograms. These spectrograms are then log-transformed and normalized before being concatenated for input into an EfficientNetB0-based convolutional neural network (CNN). The CNN extracts 1024-channel feature maps, which are globally pooled using 2D pooling before being fed into a transformer architecture with multi-headed attention mechanisms. Dropout layers are incorporated to mitigate overfitting during training. The final output is a probability distribution across six classes of harmful brain activity: SZ (seizure), LPD (lateralized periodic discharge), GPD (generalized periodic discharge), LRDA (lateralized rhythmic delta activity), GRDA (generalized rhythmic delta activity), and OTHER. Our model achieves competitive performance compared to existing approaches, showcasing its efficacy in automating EEG pattern classification to aid clinicians and researchers in faster and more accurate detection of harmful brain activity.
